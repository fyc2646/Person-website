# Washing fruits and vegetables with baking soda solution help remove pesticide residues

Washing fruits and vegetables with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) solution has been shown to be an effective method for removing pesticide residues from produce surfaces. Here are the key findings:



## Effectiveness of Baking Soda Solution

Research has demonstrated that using a baking soda solution is more effective at removing surface pesticide residues compared to tap water or bleach.  A study found that soaking apples in a 10 mg/mL sodium bicarbonate solution for 12-15 minutes could completely remove surface residues of certain pesticides like thiabendazole and phosmet.

The effectiveness of baking soda in pesticide removal is attributed to two factors:

1. Alkaline pH: Most pesticides are unstable in alkaline conditions, which helps break down the compounds.

2. Physical removal: The baking soda solution assists in physically washing away the pesticide residues.

   

## Pesticide Reduction Rates

Studies have shown that washing produce in a baking soda solution can reduce pesticide residues by 66.7â€“98.9%. Some research even suggests that baking soda can remove up to 96% of pesticides from fruit and vegetables when gently rubbed on the surface.



## Recommended Method

To effectively use baking soda for washing produce:

1. Mix about one teaspoon of baking soda into two cups of water.

2. Soak fruits and vegetables in this solution for 12-15 minutes.

3. Rinse thoroughly with clean water after soaking.

   

## Limitations

While baking soda is highly effective for surface residues, it has limitations:

1. Internalized pesticides: Baking soda cannot remove pesticides that have penetrated into the fruit or vegetable.

2. Systemic pesticides: Some pesticides, like thiabendazole, can penetrate deeper into produce and cannot be completely removed by washing.

   

## Alternative Methods

For more thorough pesticide removal, consider:

1. Peeling: This is more effective for removing penetrated pesticides, but it also removes beneficial nutrients in the peel.
2. Vinegar solution: Mixing one part vinegar with three parts water can also help remove pesticides and kill bacteria.

In conclusion, while not perfect, using a baking soda solution is one of the most effective household methods for reducing pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables. It's a simple, safe, and accessible way to minimize pesticide exposure from produce.
